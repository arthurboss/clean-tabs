### Clean Tabs
A web-app to visualise musical tabs with the cleanest possible UI.

**...this is a project in progress...**

### Inspiration / Goal
Music websites tend to have invasive pop-us, ads and bad interfaces, leading to a disturbing and frustrating experience for those who simply want to grab their instrument for a moment and follow along the tabs/lyrics of a song. That's what clean-tabs attempts to solve.

Focused on UX, the goal is to provide the cleanest possible UI to keep the focus on what the user came looking for: **making music**!

### Core Technical Concepts

This project is made with [React 18@alpha](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and managed with [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/).

The technical choices are made based on the goal of trying out new technologies whilst providing great performance for the web-app.

### Getting Started
You'll need Yarn v2 or above. If not yet installed, follow [this guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
To run the application locally, follow the below steps:

- run `yarn` to install the dependencies;
- run `yarn dev` to start the development server.
- open up `http://localhost:8000/` on your browser and start having fun!

**note:** additionally, go to `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` to use GraphQL's IDE and interact with the available queries for the application.
